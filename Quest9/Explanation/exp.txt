The program demonstrates zombie process prevention in Linux.

Multiple child processes are created using fork(). When a child process terminates, the parent process calls wait() to collect the child's exit status.

This ensures that terminated child processes do not remain in the zombie state.

The parent prints the PID of each child it cleans up, showing proper process management.

The absence of zombie processes is verified using the ps command.
