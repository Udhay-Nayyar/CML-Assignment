The script log_analyzer.sh processes a log file provided as a command-line argument.

It validates that the file exists and is readable before analyzing it.

The script counts the total number of log entries and categorizes them based on INFO, WARNING, and ERROR levels using grep and wc commands.

It identifies the most recent ERROR message and generates a summary report file named with the current date.

Proper error handling ensures meaningful messages are displayed for invalid inputs.
