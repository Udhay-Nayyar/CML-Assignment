The patterns.sh script processes words from input.txt by splitting them into individual entries using the tr command.

Regular expressions with grep are used to categorize words containing only vowels, only consonants, and mixed words that begin with a consonant.

Case-insensitive matching ensures accurate classification regardless of letter case.

The results are redirected into vowels.txt, consonants.txt, and mixed.txt respectively.
