The validate_results.sh script reads student data from marks.txt.

Using a while loop, the script processes each record and checks subject marks against the passing criteria of 33.

Conditionals and arithmetic operations are used to count failures per student.

Students failing in exactly one subject and those passing all subjects are displayed, along with category counts.

The script also validates file existence to ensure proper error handling.
