The emailcleaner.sh script processes a list of email addresses from emails.txt.

Using grep with a regular expression, valid emails matching the required format are extracted and stored in valid.txt.

Invalid emails are redirected to invalid.txt.

The sort and uniq commands are used to remove duplicate entries from the valid email list.

The script also checks for file existence to ensure proper error handling.
