The bg_move.sh script accepts a directory path and moves each file into a backup subdirectory.

Each move operation is executed in the background using the & operator, and the process ID of each task is displayed using $!.

The script PID is shown using $$, and the wait command ensures that all background processes complete before the script exits.

Proper argument and directory validation provide robust error handling.
